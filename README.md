Repo for Research work (CornellNLP) on the DDO dataset

## Figures
pol -> Political ideologies

rel -> Religious ideologies

fickle -> changing stance more often than unchanging (changing 60% of the time or more)

*Note:* 60% is a threshold **variable**, one could change that in the code to set a custom threshold
